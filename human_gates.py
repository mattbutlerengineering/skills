"""human_gates: what the three human gates are, and how to read one
issue's label history against them (ADR-0056).

The gates are the factory's only human decision points (ADR-0033;
CONTEXT.md: PRD approval, blueprint/ADR approval, PR merge), so their
queues live on the work orders' mirrored issues as `wo:` lifecycle
labels (ADR-0032, ADR-0035): `wo:draft` waits at the PRD gate,
`wo:prd-approved` at the blueprint gate, `wo:needs-review` at the merge
gate. This module owns that vocabulary and the walk over it — the
label-event stream, the completed-stay partition, the current stay's
start, and (refused_timestamps) how many events that stream silently
dropped.

Its callers are thin: gate_digest.py keeps the confirmed stays as
latency rows, rejection_mining.py harvests the rest, dashboard.py ages
the open ones, and gates.py's detector J asks which labels the gates
name. They differ in what a stay MEANS to them, never in what a stay
IS, which is the whole reason this is one module and their fetches,
posts and compositions are not.

Pure by construction: no gh, no ledger, no filesystem, no clock. Events
in, gate facts out, testable with a literal list — which is why the
timeline fetch that produces those events stays with the tools that own
its failure meaning (ADR-0051).
