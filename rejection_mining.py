"""rejection_mining: the weekly toolsmith-queue harvest (PRD-0001
§User stories, WO-0018).

The toolsmith charter's Mine stage wants the correction stream in one
place before any rule is written. Two streams exist on the dispatch
plane, and this tool reads both through the injected gh runner (same
seam as gate_digest.py, so tests never touch the network):

- gate rejections — a `wo:` queue stay that ended WITHOUT the gate's
  pass label. These are exactly the stays human_gates.gate_passages
  deliberately skips: a flip to wo:failed / wo:blocked records no
  latency row there, so this tool is where those flips finally land.
  One walk answers both (human_gates.completed_stays, ADR-0056): the
  digest keeps the confirmed stays, this keeps the rest.
- PR change-requests — CHANGES_REQUESTED reviews on the work orders'
  PRs, joined to their WO through the `Closes #N` grammar
  (knowledge_plane.CLOSES_TOKEN).

The harvest is upserted as one pinned, marker-tagged queue issue —
the gate digest's tracker idiom (ADR-0035): created and pinned on
first run, edited in place every week after. Recurrence counts lead
each entry because the charter counts recurrences before writing a
rule — one rejection is an anecdote — and the evidence is quoted
(review bodies excerpted), never summarized into existence.

Conventions match gate_digest.py: functions return rm:-prefixed problem
strings; the CLI prints them and exits nonzero.

  python3 rejection_mining.py mine
        Harvest gate rejections and change-requested reviews for the
        mirrored work orders, then create-or-update the pinned
        toolsmith-queue issue.
