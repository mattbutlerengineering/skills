"""The pipeline protocol's executable knowledge, in one place.

docs/pipeline-protocol.md is the spec; this module is its one
implementation. It owns the stage/skill taxonomy, the artifact tables

reading, the skill-file contract (path shape and frontmatter rules,
ADR-0052), the UX conditional, the re-entry conditional, the checkbox
rule, the retro short-circuit, and next-stage derivation (ADR-0021).
