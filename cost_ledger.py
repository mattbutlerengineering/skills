"""cost_ledger: the one home of the append-only cost ledger's shape
(ADR-0034, ADR-0037) — docs/factory/costs.jsonl's path, field set, line
grammar, and the append/read operations over it.

Before this seam the shape lived in three places: budget_guard.py wrote
lines, detector G (gates.py) validated them in full, and
cost_report.read_ledger hand-rolled a partial re-validation that its own
docstring admitted could diverge from G. Now G and the report read the
same grammar: parse/line_problems are the single rule, G layers its
breakdown cross-checks on top, and read() is the report's reader whose
excluded-line problems ARE the CI rule's field checks.

Conventions match gates.py: read() returns ledger:-prefixed problem
strings; parse/line_problems return unlocated suffixes for callers that
prefix their own label and location (detector G keeps its G: strings
byte-for-byte).
