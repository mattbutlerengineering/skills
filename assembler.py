"""assembler: the brain behind .github/workflows/assembler.yml (PRD-0001;
ADR-0032 dispatch plane, ADR-0033 human gates, ADR-0034 routing bands).

The workflow names no commands of its own — it runs a `make` target, and the
judgment lands here. It reads the `issues` labeled event (GITHUB_EVENT_PATH)
and resolves, from the REPO-CONTROLLED breakdown row, everything the chartered
agent needs to run. Conventions match gates.py/validator.py: functions return
asm:-prefixed problem strings; the CLI prints them and exits nonzero.

Two invariants here are security properties, not conveniences (ADR-0032):

  1. Only the repo owner may apply wo:ready-for-agent. A label from anyone
     else is INERT — enforced by actor_is_owner, not by convention. The
     workflow also gates on it, so a non-owner never even spins the job up;
     this is the tested authority behind that gate, and it fails closed.
  2. The dispatched agent's prompt substrate is the breakdown ROW, never the
     raw issue body. The issue body is attacker-controllable (anyone can open
     or comment on an issue); the breakdown row only lands through a merged,
     owner-reviewed PR (ADR-0004 knowledge plane). resolve_row reads the row
     and the body never enters assemble_prompt — the prompt-injection boundary.

  python3 assembler.py resolve
        Resolve the labeled issue into dispatch outputs (dispatch, wo,
        charter, band, model, prompt) written to $GITHUB_OUTPUT for the
        workflow's claude-code-action step. A non-owner or non-ready label,
        or an issue still flagged budget-exhausted (ADR-0034: the owner must
        clear it to re-dispatch), is a no-op (dispatch=false, exit 0). A
        genuine misconfiguration — an owner-applied ready label on an
        unflagged issue with no work-order row, a charter with no band, a
        band the routing table does not cover — is a problem (exit nonzero)
        so the owner sees it.

  python3 assembler.py find-pr <issue>
        Locate the open PR whose body Closes the issue (the dispatched
        agent's delivery) and write pr=<number> to $GITHUB_OUTPUT for
        the validator-dispatch step — GitHub suppresses pull_request
        events for GITHUB_TOKEN-created PRs (WO-0030), so the workflow
        triggers validator.yml by hand with this number. No match
        writes pr= empty and exits nonzero: the agent ran but delivered
        no traceable PR, which the owner must see.
