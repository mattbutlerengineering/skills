"""cli: the shared adapter over an external CLI (ADR-0037).

Two tools shell out to a binary and turn its failures into problem
strings — label_sync.py (gh) and budget_guard.py (git) — and before this
seam each carried a byte-identical copy of the failure tuple and the
one-line detail formatter. Two adapters make the seam real: the failure
vocabulary and its formatting live here once; each caller keeps its own
port (gh_runner returns stdout, git_runner the CompletedProcess) and its
own problem-string label. Tests inject a fake runner so they never touch
a real CLI.
