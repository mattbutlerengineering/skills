"""knowledge_plane: the shared grammar and layout of the knowledge plane
(ADR-0004, ADR-0037) — the typed-ID token grammar, the run-directory
layout, and where a factory tool finds the repo root.

These primitives grew up inside gates.py because its detectors needed
them first, but every dispatch-plane tool reads the same plane:
assembler.py resolves breakdown rows, validator.py maps work orders to
tracker issues, orientation_pack.py bundles cited ADRs, budget_guard.py
and cost_report.py locate the repo — and each imported gates for the
privilege, while label_sync.py carried its own repo_root copy. ADR-0037
gives the plane's grammar one home; gates.py keeps only the detectors.

parse_run (ADR-0039's amendment, ADR-0068) widens the walk from
run_dirs/breakdown_files to the run-level artifacts several detectors
independently re-read 3-4x per pass — still read-only, still no
row/slice policy. Issue #442 wired gate detectors A, C, D, G, H and I
onto it; `scannable` is the one addition that migration made: gates.py
keeps `_scannable_files` (its OWN policy — which directories count as
"scannable" is a gates.py detector choice, not run layout), and hands
parse_run the already-selected path list to read once, alongside
everything else this function already reads once.

    issue #441's "expand" step of an expand->migrate->contract
    sequence): detector A (check_wo_citation) and detector G
    (check_cost_ledger, through both collect_wo_rows and merged_wo_rows)
    each call breakdown_files independently, so one run_all pass
    re-globs and re-reads every breakdown.md up to four times; detectors
    C, D and I each independently re-glob and re-read the same wider
    markdown tree via gates._scannable_files. parse_run widens the
    walk-only seam to read the run-level overlap once, as plain data —
    a dict of lists/tuples, no class, matching every other accessor in
    this module (there is no dataclass/NamedTuple precedent here to
    follow instead).

    Issue #441 added this function, unused; issue #442 (the "migrate"
    step) wired detectors A, C, D, G, H and I onto it — gates.run_all
    now calls parse_run once per pass and hands the same parsed dict to
    each of those six, and each of their own filesystem reads is gone.

    `scannable`: an iterable of Paths the CALLER has already selected
    (gates._scannable_files(root), for detectors C, D and I) — read once
    each, in the given order, into the "scannable" key below. Selecting
    WHICH paths count as scannable stays gates.py's own policy (which
    directories to walk, which to exclude, is a detector choice, not run
    layout — issue #441 flagged this and left the call for #442, which
    chose to keep the selection in gates.py and hand parse_run the
    already-selected list, so this module still owns no directory-walk
    policy beyond run_dirs). The default `()` reads nothing, so callers
    that never touch "scannable" (detectors A, G, H) pay nothing for it.

    Deliberately NOT covered here: detector E (the template payload's
    byte hashes, via manifest_files), F (factory.json, via
    factory_config.py), G's OWN ledger read (docs/factory/costs.jsonl,
    via cost_ledger.py — G's collect_wo_rows/merged_wo_rows cross-checks
    moved here, but the ledger file itself is cost_ledger.py's dedicated
    seam), J (.github/labels.json + the Makefile, via label_sync.py) and
    B (the CI event payload, via cli.read_event) each already read their
    own artifact exactly once, through their own dedicated seam or
    single-pass function — there was no cross-detector re-read to remove
    there, so #442 left them untouched.
