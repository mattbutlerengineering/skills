"""work-queue: plan a batch of work orders to run in parallel.

The `work-queue` skill's compute half (ADR-0023 utility skill; ADR-0032
two planes). It COMPUTES and prices a batch; it never dispatches, never
labels, never merges — the skill runs the agents, and a human merges the
PRs (ADR-0033 gate 3). Same compute/mutate split as cost_report.py.

  python3 work_queue.py plan            the batch, as a report
  python3 work_queue.py plan --json     the same batch, machine-readable

A work order is eligible only when BOTH planes agree (ADR-0032: the
dispatch plane never runs ahead of the knowledge plane):

  knowledge plane  an unchecked breakdown row whose every `blocked by:`
                   edge is already checked off
  dispatch plane   its mirrored issue carrying wo:ready-for-agent — the
                   label the repo OWNER applies, which is what makes this
                   queue opt-in rather than "everything not done yet"

Batch size is factory.json's wip_cap, and the batch is priced from each
row's `size:` band against month-to-date ledger spend and monthly_cap_usd
(ADR-0034), so an over-cap batch is refused BEFORE any agent is paid for.

Conventions match lint.py/gates.py: functions return label-prefixed
problem strings; the CLI prints them and exits nonzero.
