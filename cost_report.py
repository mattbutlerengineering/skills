"""cost_report: the ADR-0034 weekly rollup and monthly circuit breaker.
Recomputes spend numbers from docs/factory/costs.jsonl — read through
cost_ledger.read, the same line grammar detector G gates in CI (ADR-0037),
so the report's reader cannot diverge from the CI rule — and decides
whether the report month's spend (rows whose `at` date falls in it;
ADR-0034's monthly window) has crossed factory.json's monthly_cap_usd.
Conventions match budget_guard.py: functions return cr:-prefixed problem
strings (ledger problems keep cost_ledger's ledger: prefix, the same way
validator.py surfaces label_sync's L: strings); the CLI prints them and
exits nonzero.

This module COMPUTES ONLY: aggregate the ledger, decide PAUSE/CONTINUE
against the cap, and compose the report text. All IO is injected (the
ledger path, the clock) so it is unit-testable without touching real time
or a real repository, and it never shells out to gh. The workflow
(.github/workflows/cost-report.yml) is the one that MUTATES — it posts the
report issue and, on a PAUSE verdict, sets the FACTORY_PAUSED repo
variable (`gh variable set`, readable as `vars.FACTORY_PAUSED` by any
workflow's `if:`, the same vars.* convention sweeps.yml's Sentry job and
validator.yml's FACTORY_REVIEW_LOGIN already use) — both real gh
mutations, so they stay in the YAML, never here.

  python3 cost_report.py report
        Recompute spend from docs/factory/costs.jsonl, decide against
        factory.json's monthly_cap_usd, and write title/body/pause/reason
        to $GITHUB_OUTPUT for the workflow's gh steps. Exits nonzero only
        on a genuine misconfiguration (fails CLOSED: an unreadable ledger
        or unresolvable cap decides PAUSE and still exits nonzero, so a
        broken config can never silently wave spend through unpaused).
