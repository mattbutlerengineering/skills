"""orientation_pack: the knowledge-plane context bundle folded into a
dispatched work order's prompt (WO-0015; ADR-0032 dispatch plane).

Named orientation_pack.py, not orientation.py: "orientation" already
names an unrelated concept in this repo — the idea-to-prod pipeline's
"which stage is next" decision table (ADR-0021, protocol.py's
next_stage, pinned by tests/test_orientation.py against
tests/fixtures/orientation/; the root orientation.py CLI adapter over
it has since been deleted as a zero-caller pass-through). The factory
shares this repo's root namespace with that pipeline, so the two
"orientation" concepts needed different names; see
docs/features/software-factory/breakdown.md's WO-0015 Notes for the
citation.

Same seam discipline as assembler.py: every function takes `root` (a repo
tree, not an injected reader object) and reads real files under it, tested
against tempfile fixture trees. And the same prompt-injection boundary
(ADR-0032): orientation_pack takes root, a work order id, and the
repo-controlled breakdown ROW — never an issue body or GitHub event, so
there is no channel for attacker-controlled text to reach the pack.
