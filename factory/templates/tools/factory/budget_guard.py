"""budget_guard: the ADR-0034 stop-or-continue check for a dispatched work
order — CONTINUE while spend is within its size class's dollar budget,
HARD-STOP at or over it. Conventions match assembler.py: functions return
bg:-prefixed problem strings; the CLI prints them and exits nonzero.

This is one of THREE uncorrelated stops ADR-0034 puts around every
dispatched run (token budget, max-turns cap, wall-clock timeout) — the
dollar-budget stop, checked against the run's own running spend. Exhaustion
is a HANDOFF, not a failure (ADR-0034): hard_stop pushes whatever is on
disk (push_wip), composes and posts a handoff naming the remaining
acceptance criteria (handoff.compose), and appends the run's line to the
append-only cost ledger (cost_ledger.entry / cost_ledger.append) —
RESILIENTLY, so a WIP-push failure (the normal no-upstream case) still
leaves the handoff and ledger behind. See
docs/adr/0034-work-order-budgets-and-routing.md.

  python3 budget_guard.py check <size> <spend_usd>
        Resolve <size>'s dollar budget from factory.json and print CONTINUE
        or HARD-STOP against <spend_usd>. Exits nonzero only on a genuine
        misconfiguration (fails CLOSED: an unresolvable budget prints
        HARD-STOP and still exits nonzero, so a broken config can never
        silently wave a run through).

  python3 budget_guard.py record <wo> <run_id> <model> <tokens> <cost>
                                 [outcome]
        Append ONE completed run's line to the ledger (outcome defaults to
        "completed"). The success-path counterpart to hard_stop: until this
        existed, hard_stop was the only in-repo writer of a dispatched-run
        row, so the ledger recorded exhausted runs and nothing else and the
        monthly circuit breaker summed a total that could only ever be
        $0.00 (issue #222). Refuses BEFORE writing on a malformed row or a
        (wo, run_id) already recorded.

  python3 budget_guard.py record-run <wo> <run_id> <model>
                                     <execution_file> [outcome]
        record, with tokens and cost read from the claude-code-action
        execution file the dispatched run left behind (cli.read_execution)
        — the assembler workflow's caller (issue #222), so the figures are
        the harness's own record, never hand-typed. Refuses BEFORE writing
        on any file it cannot account for.
