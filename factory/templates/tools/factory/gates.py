"""Factory gate detectors (PRD-0001; ADR-0032, ADR-0033, ADR-0034).

Offline, gating checks over the knowledge plane, following the same
conventions as lint.py: every checker takes the repo root and returns
label-prefixed problem strings; the CLI prints them and exits nonzero.
Lettered detectors (audit-evals.py style, letters shared with the
ai-tooling suite where the rule is the same idea):

  A WO-CITATION    — every breakdown work-order row cites a PRD id
  B PR-TRACEABILITY — PR body carries a WO id and a closing keyword
                     (event-payload; SKIP locally)
  C LINK-INTEGRITY — every PRD-####/ADR-####/WO-#### token resolves;
                     duplicate PRD ids fail
  D BLUEPRINT-DRIFT — the approved blueprint (docs/adr) is self-consistent:
                     every ADR declares a known status and is indexed with
                     that status in docs/adr/README.md, and no artifact
                     outside docs/adr builds on a superseded decision
  E SCAFFOLD-SYNC  — factory/manifest.json checksums match the template
                     payload (no hand-edited mirrors), and in a stamped
                     repo the executable payload in use — tools/factory/
                     and .github/workflows/ — matches what it was stamped
                     from (no hand-edited stamped files)
  F CONFIG-SHAPE   — factory config parses and every field is a valid
                     token (budgets, routing, caps)
  J LABEL-WIRING   — every label the tools and the Makefile's lifecycle
                     targets name exists in the label taxonomy, and the
                     taxonomy file itself is readable; the taxonomy is
                     the repo's to curate (so nothing checksums it), and
                     a pruned label or an unparseable file would
                     otherwise surface only when CI flips a label, at
                     dispatch or merge time
  G COST-LEDGER    — docs/factory/costs.jsonl lines carry the ADR-0034
                     fields and every merged (checked) work-order row has
                     one; an absent ledger is silent (no runs recorded yet)
  H EVIDENCE-HONESTY — every verification.md section that asserts a LABELLED
                     verdict (Result/Verdict/Outcome/Status) shows literal
                     fenced output or discloses NOT RUN, in its OWN section
                     scope (an appendix fence vouches for nothing; a scoped
                     hedge is not a disclaimer; there is no roll-up excuse);
                     and an artifact with neither output nor a written
                     NOT-RUN disclaimer anywhere fails outright
  I STALENESS      — no knowledge-plane doc links to a path that no longer
                     exists on disk

The letter namespace does not end at I. Detector L (LABEL-SYNC) is
network-side and lives in label_sync.py, driven by scheduled sweeps —
network calls stay out of this offline gate — and J/K are unclaimed.
DETECTORS (beside CHECKERS below) is the full roster.

`--selftest` runs the checkers against fixture trees and exits nonzero
on a failing assertion. Both run in CI (validator.yml, via `make check`)
on every push/PR.

The knowledge plane's shared grammar (typed-ID tokens, run_dirs,
repo_root) lives in knowledge_plane.py, and the cost ledger's shape in
cost_ledger.py (ADR-0037) — this module keeps only the detectors.

# Not every factory PR implements a work order: a governance or chore PR

# Only a LABELLED verdict line asserts a verdict. The label is not just
# "Result": a criterion is just as asserted under "Verdict:", "Outcome:",
# "Conclusion:", "Assessment:", "Finding:" — so the rule engages on the whole
# verdict-noun vocabulary (case-insensitive, with an optional list bullet and
# bold markers, and a non-empty value). A four-label whitelist was itself the
# gate's escape hatch: a lying section only had to relabel its verdict line to
# become invisible, which is the same "rename it and the gate goes quiet" move
# the roll-up excuse allowed. The vocabulary below is the closed set of words
# that ASSERT A JUDGEMENT. Words that introduce an INPUT or an aside —
# "Check:", "Command:", "Note:", "Caveat:", "Evidence:" — are deliberately NOT
# verdicts: they carry no claim, and reading them as claims false-positives on
# every honest artifact that documents what it ran.
#
# Nothing else asserts anything. Unlabelled prose and heading text are read
# as prose: an author may open a note with "Done.", title a section "all
# checks pass", and — decisively — write TEMPLATE.md's `## Summary` as the
# narrative roll-up it is meant to be, all without owing output. Reading
# prose and headings as verdicts is what forced the previous roll-up EXCUSE
# ("a section named Summary/Results/… need not evidence itself, provided
# some other section does"), and that excuse was the gate's own escape
# hatch: rename the lying section, or park one throwaway evidenced leaf
# beside it, and the gate went quiet. With only labelled lines asserting, no
# excuse is needed and none exists — every labelled verdict is backed IN ITS
# OWN SECTION, wherever it is written.
# The leading-marker class is deliberately wide. A verdict is just as asserted
# under a blockquote (`> Result: PASS`) or an ordered-list item (`1. Result:
# PASS`) as under a `-` bullet, and GitHub renders all three as visible verdict
# text — so a marker-only whitelist was itself an escape hatch (an independent
# review smuggled a fake PASS past the `-*+`-only form under `>` and `1.`).
# Any run of list/quote markers may lead the line; the verdict noun is what
# makes it a verdict, not the marker. Two more wrappers GitHub renders as a
# visible verdict join the leading class (#151): a table cell's leading pipe
# (`| Result: PASS |`, a row a human reads as PASS) and an inline `<summary>`
# open tag (`<summary>Result: PASS</summary>`, an always-visible clickable
# verdict). Both close with a trailing delimiter — ` |` / `</summary>` — that
# the value capture drops OUTSIDE the group, so `_is_disclosure` still reads
# the verdict's true head (a table-cell `NOT VERIFIED` still discloses).

# checkable against the tree, and a doc that has stopped describing it is
# stale — the finding is the drift, not the file.
#
# The hard part is that architecture.md describes TWO trees: this repo, and
# the repo the payload stamps. It also names files that are PLANNED and do not
# exist yet (a roadmap line naming `validator.yml` before WO-0004 lands). So
# "every path it mentions must exist" is not the rule — it would false-positive
# on an honest doc, which is the failure that killed two attempts at detector
# H. Only two things are read as claims about the CURRENT tree:
#
#   1. PROSE, on a CLOSED keyword vocabulary, anchored so that the code span
#      ends a clause. "there is no `Makefile`," asserts absence; "no `gates.py`
#      change is needed" modifies a NOUN and asserts nothing. "`X` exists here"
#      asserts presence, and "here" is the doc's OWN word for "in this repo"
#      (it writes "no `Makefile` ... here", "`.github/CODEOWNERS` exists here")
#      — which is exactly what separates a claim about this tree from a claim
#      about a stamped one. Missing a hedged claim is the safe error; firing on
#      an honest sentence is not.
#   2. A DECLARED claim block, which is the only way to pin a presence claim
#      that prose states behaviourally ("`checks.yml` runs lint..." asserts the
#      file exists, but no keyword says so). Declaring it follows the same rule
#      the review token's provenance does: what is not declared is not assumed.
