"""label-sync: detector L (LABEL-SYNC) — the GitHub label taxonomy must
match .github/labels.json (PRD-0001; ADR-0033 lifecycle labels).

A NETWORK detector: it reads the live label set through the gh CLI, so it
runs in scheduled sweeps only and is NEVER wired into gates.py CHECKERS
(those stay offline). Conventions match gates.py/lint.py: functions return
L:-prefixed problem strings; the CLI prints them and exits nonzero.

  python3 label_sync.py           report drift (gh label list)
  python3 label_sync.py --apply   also create/update each drifted label
                                  (gh label create --force)

Drift is one-way: labels outside the taxonomy are ignored (GitHub's
default labels are not drift), so --apply never deletes anything.
