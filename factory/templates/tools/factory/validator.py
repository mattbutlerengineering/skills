"""validator: the brain behind .github/workflows/validator.yml and the
assembler workflow's claim step (PRD-0001; ADR-0032 lifecycle labels,
ADR-0033 gate 3).

The workflows name no repo tool of their own — every tool invocation goes
through a `make` target, because the Makefile is the seam that knows where
a repo keeps its tools (root here, tools/factory/ there) — and the ones
that need judgment land here. The shell plumbing AROUND those targets is
not a tool and does not move between repos: gh, git, and the review job's
exit-code capture stay in the workflow. The PR-shaped legs read the
pull_request event payload (GITHUB_EVENT_PATH), and pr-event below writes
the one a dispatched run stands in for; the claim leg is handed its issue
number outright. All reach GitHub through the gh CLI, which is injected so
tests never touch the network (same shape as label_sync.py).
Conventions match gates.py/label_sync.py: functions return V:-prefixed
problem strings; the CLI prints them and exits nonzero.

  python3 validator.py pr-event --pr <N> --out <path>
        The dispatch shim (WO-0030). GitHub suppresses the pull_request
        event for a PR the factory's own token opened, so the validator is
        dispatched against a PR NUMBER — and the legs below still need an
        event to read. Write the payload cli.read_event will hand them.
        One owner for a shape three workflow steps used to build by hand.

  python3 validator.py review --findings <file> [--status <rc>]
        Post the check run's output on the PR as review findings, from an
        actor that is not the PR's author — PRD-0001: no work is verified by
        the agent that produced it. The reviewing identity is derived from
        the TOKEN (see reviewer_login), not from a variable that declares it;
        anything unresolved or self-reviewing refuses to post (nonzero,
        nothing said). Red findings are posted and do NOT fail the review
        job: failing the build is the check job's work, and a reviewer that
        goes silent on red is useless.

  python3 validator.py lifecycle --label wo:merged --uncited skip
        The merge leg. Make <label> the only wo: lifecycle label on the
        work order's mirrored issue (ADR-0032: exactly one at a time). The
        issue number comes from the breakdown row, never from the issue
        itself — the knowledge plane is authoritative and the mirror is
        one-way.

  python3 validator.py lifecycle --label wo:needs-review --uncited skip
        The PR-open leg: same PR-shaped resolution.

        Both legs pass --uncited skip (ADR-0057), so a PR citing no work
        order is a silent no-op on each — human housekeeping PRs are
        normal traffic, not errors. "Citing" means naming one OUTSIDE
        quoted material (ADR-0064): a token in a fenced block or a
        blockquote is something the PR is discussing. A PR that NAMES a
        work order in its own prose and resolves none stays a problem on
        both.

  python3 validator.py lifecycle --label wo:in-progress --issue <N>
        The dispatch claim: flip a KNOWN issue (no PR to resolve) and
        write transitioned=true/false to $GITHUB_OUTPUT — true only when
        the flip took the order out of wo:ready-for-agent, which is the
        assembler's idempotency verdict (a repeat label event gets false
        and the paid agent step is skipped).

  python3 validator.py lifecycle --label wo:failed --issue <N> --verdict skip
        The dispatch failure leg: the same KNOWN-issue flip, writing no
        verdict. The assembler runs it from a failure() step, so an order
        whose agent run died lands on wo:failed instead of sitting on
        wo:in-progress forever — the state both the gate digest and the
        improvement routine read as work still in flight.

Which lifecycle labels machinery writes, and which it deliberately does
not (ADR-0045). The assembler claims (wo:in-progress) and reports its own
failures (wo:failed); the PR legs above record the merge queue
(wo:needs-review) and its exit (wo:merged). The three gate labels are
applied by the humans who pass the gates. wo:blocked is human- or
Planner-applied by design: it means an unmet dependency, and that graph
lives in the issue tracker, not in CI. No workflow flips it — its absence
from this file is a decision, not a hole.
